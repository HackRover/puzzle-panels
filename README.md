# puzzle-panels
<p><h2>
A repository for all puzzle panel software.
</h2></p><bk><p>
Current has Button from Michael Adams https://github.com/madleech/Button
</p><p>
Intro to the Button Library:
  </p><p>
In the SetUp Arduino you need to call the Button Begin to init the Button object.
  </p><p>
There are two different types of buttons in this library.
  </p><p>
They are Pressed, Toggle mode.
  </p><p>
Using the basic_usage.ino in the example to see how to use two different types of button modes.

<p>All files except Boolean need to be tested. Rotary need to be rewritten in C++ to be imported into Arduino IDE. RGB and LED need to be tested. Boolean library is written and tested. Can be further optimized. Each libraries READMEs need to be rewritten. Documentation for each library needs to be written in LaTeX. https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/contributions/arduino-creating-library-guide. This is the link on how to create Arduino libraries. Insert original authors from the public files as needed
  
  TODO: 1) reformat all individual components README, 2) rewrite general README for all puzzle panel components, 3) rewrite headers and comments for all files, and 4) write a template file for .h and .cpp files for creation of future library files. Link how to create custom Arduino libraries</p>
